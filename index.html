    <p class="description">
        Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food featuring marinated meat (lamb, chicken, beef) stacked on a vertical rotisserie, slow-roasted, and shaved off in thin slices, then served in a flatbread (like pita) with various toppings and sauces (tahini, garlic sauce, pickles). Originating from the Ottoman Empire, its name means "turning" from the Turkish şevirme, referring to the rotating spit, making it a flavorful, protein-rich meal known for its savory spices and juicy texture
